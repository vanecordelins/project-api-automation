## Tasks: Configurable base URL

- [x] Create `utils/config.js` to define `BASE_URL` from `SERVEREST_BASE_URL` (defaulting to `https://serverest.dev`)
- [x] Create `utils/pactumSetup.js` to set Pactum base URL once
- [x] Refactor step definitions to use relative paths instead of hardcoded host
- [x] Refactor `utils/auth.js` to use configured base URL
- [x] Update `README.md` with environment variable usage example
- [ ] Run `npm test` to validate behavior (blocked in this environment: Node/npm not available)
