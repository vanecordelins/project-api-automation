## Product context

This repository is an automated API test suite for the ServeRest API, written in JavaScript with Cucumber (BDD) and Pactum for HTTP requests. It validates common user flows (create/get/update/delete users) and generates a Cucumber HTML report for CI.

## Primary goals

- Provide reliable, readable API checks aligned to feature files
- Keep steps easy to maintain and reuse
- Run consistently in CI and locally

## Non-goals

- Building the API itself
- Performance/load testing
