## AI-Assisted SDD evidence (submission blurb)

I created an AI-Assisted SDD trail for this repo by adding steering docs (`product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`) plus a lightweight `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` for a small maintainability improvement. Following the tasks, I implemented a configurable API base URL (`SERVEREST_BASE_URL`, defaulting to `https://serverest.dev`) by centralizing Pactum configuration and refactoring step definitions/auth to use relative endpoints. This demonstrates AI‑Assisted SDD by linking written requirements/design decisions to concrete code changes and an auditable commit history.

### Submission option

- Option 1 (Commit link): add the commit URL from the repo history (see `git log`).
